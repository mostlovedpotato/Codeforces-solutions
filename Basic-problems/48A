Here in this problem we just have to check on the conditions if it ' rss ' then first player win as so on so we use normal ternary operator 
and wirte our solution as 


 
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#include<set>
#include<algorithm>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	string s[3],x;
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
		cin >> s[i];
		x += s[i].at(0);                       // as our inputs are like rock paper ans scissor we are only taking the first char 
	}
	cout << (x == "prr" || x == "rss" || x == "spp" ? "F"
		: x == "rpr" || x == "srs" || x == "psp" ? "M"
		: x == "rrp" || x == "ssr" || x == "pps" ? "S" : "?");
}
