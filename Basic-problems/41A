So, Here in this problem we are just to reverse the string which is the input and compare those two if they are reverse of each other then 
it's ok otherwise ' No '

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main(){
	char s1[101],s2[101];
	scanf("%s %s",s1,s2);
	puts(strcmp(s1,strrev(s2)) ? "NO" : "YES");
  }
  .
  
  Using ternary operator and strcmp and strrev
