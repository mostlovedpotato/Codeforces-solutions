Here, In this problem we have to find the average of all numbers which are representation for some number in that base.
so we first find those all numbers we add them up .


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main (void)
{
	int n,t,k=0,s=0,x;
	
	cin >> n;
	
	for(int i=2;i<n;i++)
	{
		t=n;
		k++;
		while(t>0)
		{
			s = s+t%i;
			t=t/i;
		}
	}
	x = __gcd(s,k);
	cout << s/x << '/' << k/x << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
