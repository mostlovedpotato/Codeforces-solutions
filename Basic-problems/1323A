So, Here in this problem we have to find only one pair if it is pair or the one element if that is even and belongs that set.
We can simply do this in consideration of the problem itself finding loophole in the problem by implementing the following code.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int t;
int main() 
{
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
		int ans=0,n=0;cin>>n;
		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		{
			int x;cin>>x;
			if(x%2==0)ans=i;
		}
		if(ans) printf("1\n%d\n",ans);
		else 
		{
			if(n==1)cout<<"-1\n";
			else cout<<"2\n1 2\n";
		}
	}
	return 0;
} 


Here we output the first even integer if it is present or if even integer is not present we simply return that the first two indexes are 
containing the odd numbers and will give the sum as even so, we just output indexes 1 and 2 lol that's dammn funny about this problem.
