In this problem we are to make the given sequence of charcter in increasing order keeping
+ at their own position we can do this in very beutiful way by just traversing and 
swapping the in between charcters for sorting as below

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
string s;
int main()
{cin>>s;
for(int i=0;i<s.size();i+=2)
{for(int j=0;j<i;j+=2)
{if (s[i]<s[j])
swap(s[i],s[j]);}}
cout<<s<<endl;
}

in js it is much simpler .syntax 

print(readline().split('+').sort().join('+'))
