In this question we have to find the number of numbers which are greater than the number which is at position k

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int n,k,i,j,a[51]; 
int main()
{cin>>n>>k;
while(n>i)cin>>a[i++];
while(a[j]&&a[j]>=a[k-1])++j;cout<<j;}


in javascript we can do in better way

let k = readline().split(" ")[1];
let scores = readline().split(" ");
let pass = scores[k-1];
print(scores.filter( x => +x > 0 && +x >= +pass).length);
