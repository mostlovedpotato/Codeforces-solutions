Here we are just to find the no.. of smaller rectangles that can be fit into the larger square that without overlapping that's all.

#include<cstdio>
int main()
{
	int x,y;
	scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
	printf("%d",x*y/2);
}

or 

#include <iostream>
int main(){int n,m; std::cin>>n>>m; std::cout<<n*m/2;}
