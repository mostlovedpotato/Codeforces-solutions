In this problem there are only two teams so we just wanna see who have won more no. of times so we will just take input vecor or array 
of strings and then we sort that thing and then see who is at the middle position in the array or vector .

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
string s[128];
int n,i;
int main()
{
	cin>>n;
	for(i=0; i<n; ++i)cin>>s[i];
	sort(s,s+n);
	cout<<s[n/2];
}
