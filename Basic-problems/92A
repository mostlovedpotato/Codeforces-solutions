Here, In this problem we have to just distribute the chips in the circle until the time comes when he can't give the next man sufficient 
candies equal to the index.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n,m,i=1;
	cin>>n>>m;
	while(m>=i)
	{
		m -= i;
		if(i==n)
			i=0;
		i++;
	}
	cout<<m;
}
