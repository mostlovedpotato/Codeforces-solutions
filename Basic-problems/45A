I first thought about going for map in c++ as mapping each values to corresponding integers and then retreving the data as needed .
But this below solution is awesome reduction in the extra memory and time .


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int n;
int i;
string mon[12]{"January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December"};
string s;
int main()
{
    cin>>s;
    cin>>n;
    for (i=0;mon[i]!=s;i++){}
    cout<<mon[(n+i)%12]<<endl;
}
