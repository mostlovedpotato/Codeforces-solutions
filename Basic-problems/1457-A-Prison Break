The problem statement is simple and it can be concluded that we just want to calculate the 
maximum distance point from the given point so all other can automatically can reach in that time.
To know that time. 
We simply consider rectangle and you can see that only the corner points can be the farthest from any possible point
so, the distance would be simply either one of the to-vertex.
which is easy enought to understand would be.
max(x-1,n-x)+max(y-1,m-y)

#include<iostream>
#include<stdlib>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n,m;
        int x,y;
        cin>>n>>m;
        cin>>x>>y;
        cout<<max(x-1,n-x)+max(y-1,m-y)<<endl;
        return 0;
        
    }
}
