In this problem we have to find the minimum distance the photographer have to move in order to have clicked all n players.
we will see the path of the all of players and then we see for the max point of the left end of all the players and the 
min of the right end of the path of all players. 
Now we see if the left point is right to the right point then output -1 
and in other cases we find if the nearest point is left side or right side and that is point upto which he have to move.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
	int n,x;
	cin>>n>>x;
	int a,b,l=0,r=1000;
	while(n--)
	{
		cin>>a>>b;
		if(a>b)swap(a,b);
		l=max(l,a);
		r=min(r,b);
	}
	if(x>=l&&x<=r)cout<<0<<endl;
	else if(l>r)cout<<-1<<endl;
	else cout<<min(abs(x-l),abs(x-r))<<endl;
	return 0;
}
