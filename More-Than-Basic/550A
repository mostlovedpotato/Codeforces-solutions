This is kinda basic problem but if not thought in the right direction might cost you much time to solve or write code for this .
So basically we want to find the two substrings which are not overlapping so we will use the string find function here.
String find function firstly we will check the position of the first string and then from the +2 position from that previous position 
we will apply string find function again.so overall we have.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	string s;
	cin>>s;
	if(s.find("AB")!=-1&&s.find("BA",s.find("AB")+2)!=-1 || s.find("BA")!=-1 && s.find("AB",s.find("BA")+2)!=-1)
	  cout<<"YES";
	else 
    cout<<"NO";
}
