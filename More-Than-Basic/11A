Here, In this problem we have to make the given sequence increasing without any sorting. So , we here will try to make it increasing as we
go along getting the inputs so ,as the input comes we check if it is greater than previous otherwise we will add multiple of differnce and 
the given integer which compensates the differnce and the multiple we will add it to our final answer and we will repeat this 


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n=0,j,d,a,k=0,b;
	cin>>j;
	cin>>d;
	cin>>a;
	for(int i=1;i<j;i++)
	{
		cin>>b;
		if(a>=b)
		{
			n=(a-b+d)/d;
			b+=n*d;
			k+=n;
		}
		a=b;
	}
	cout<<k;
}
