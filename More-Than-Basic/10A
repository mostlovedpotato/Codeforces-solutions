Here, In this problem we have to check how much power the laptop is using as the laptop is switiching his modes out of the intervals
within the intervals it is constant power consumption as p1 but within intervals if the interval is
greater than t1 then we would say power consumed in first mode at first would be p1*min(len,t1) len if len is less than time itself
and within second mode we can go like it is power consumed if it is greater than t2 also we will gof p3 mode otherwise within p2 mode 
it is having time as len - t1  for p3 it is simply the time itself if it is within p3 or zero otherwise
so the solution is like below.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main(){
	int n,p1,p2,p3,t1,t2;
	cin>>n>>p1>>p2>>p3>>t1>>t2;
	int a[101][2];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		cin>>a[i][0]>>a[i][1];
	int num=a[0][1]-a[0][0];
	num*=p1;
	for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
		num+=(a[i][1]-a[i][0])*p1;
		int len=a[i][0]-a[i-1][1];
		num=num+p1*min(len,t1)+p2*min(max(0,len-t1),t2)+p3*max(0,len-t1-t2);
	}
	cout<<num;
	return 0;
}
