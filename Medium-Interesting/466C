In this problem which seems quite easy at first glance and after reading and then working on it will make you think it is quite complicated.
So, Here the question states that it wants three continous parts of the array which have equal sum.
So we will calculate total sum of the array and then along with we maintain one simple cumulative array as we go along.
Then next step would be we will divide the sum by ' 3 ' if it is divisible then ok otherwise the answer is ' 0 ' .
and so on for reference here is the link to the page for explanation.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
long long  a[500005],n,ans,x;
int main(){
  cin>>n;
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    cin>>a[i];
    a[i]=a[i-1]+a[i];}
   for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
      if(a[i]*3==a[n-1]*2)
           ans+=x;
      if(a[i]*3==a[n-1])
           x++;
      }
  cout<<ans;
}
